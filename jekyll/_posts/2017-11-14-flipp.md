At Event Farm, we love throwing cool events with engaging, interactive technology.

At what was, in my opinion, one of the best events of our 2403 Main Street Office, we had a Art/Music show and decided to add a little even tech on top, and what came out of it was Flipp.

Meet Flipp:

<video-container
    orientation="portrait"
    mp4="{{ "/assets/posts/2017/11/flipp/flipp-mp4.mp4" | absolute_url }}"
    webm="{{ "/assets/posts/2017/11/flipp/flipp-webm.webm" | absolute_url }}"
    poster="{{ "/assets/posts/2017/11/flipp/flipp-screenshot.png" | absolute_url }}"
></video-container>

Flipp was an interactive piece where guests of the event could enter their phone number to get access to a controller website on their mobile devices that would allow them to vote for different artworks hanging around the office, and when they voted, they would trigger a scene change on Phillips Hue lights, signaling a vote for the particular pieces.

Overall the exhibit was a huge hit, and we had a lot of fun making it.
