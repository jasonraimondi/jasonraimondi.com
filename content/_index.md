<div class="home">

<h1 class="animoji-me">Hey :wave:, I'm Jason.</h1>

## I am a <span id="adjective1">technologist</span> and <span id="adjective2">computer geek</span>.

I work at [Repeat](//getrepeat.io) as a Senior Software Engineer.

I have been developing for the web since 2007. I've worked on everything from terrible old-school procedural spaghetti :spaghetti: monsters, to MVC frameworks, to tested, domain-driven applications. Early on, I was developing traditional server-rendered PHP applications. These days, I really enjoy full stack TypeScript.

I have professional experience building modular, horizontally scalable applications.

If Iâ€™m not hanging out with my amazing [wife](//kimcalderone.com) and [pup](https://jasonraimondi.com/images/zombie-avatar_hu9363f3c1e4663e069451d44174bd9478_83191_0x1000_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp), I am most likely <span id="doing1">learning a new language</span> or <span id="doing2">practicing software architecture design patterns</span>.
