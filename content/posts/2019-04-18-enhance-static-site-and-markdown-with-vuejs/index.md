title: Enhancing your static site and markdown posts with Vue.js

Adding some dynamic elements to your static generated site can be super easy using Vue.js and some dynamic components.

In this blog, I am able to add this to my markdown files:

```html
<image-pop
    src="./imgs/william-fonteneau-1437891-unsplash-10p.jpg"
    alt="Photo by William Fonteneau on Unsplash"
></image-pop>
```

And when my code is published, it turns out a little something like this:

{{< image/pop src="./imgs/william-fonteneau-1437891-unsplash-10p.jpg" alt="Photo by William Fonteneau on Unsplash" >}}

And code to implement the feature is on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jasonraimondi/e03b0c4506901b8c9f2f62eee6fe313b).

It is a super simple way to add some life to your posts.
