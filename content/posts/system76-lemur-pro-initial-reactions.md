title: My System76 Lemur Pro Review
---

Keyboard nice

PopOS nice

Light as heck

It sometimes doesnt wake up, granted my mac did that, but it seems like more often

It takes a long time for wifi to boot

It connects to 2GHz way faster than 5GHz

Initial display was nice but not retina mac

Speakers meh

Control Keys meh

force quitting is harder

missing the command key, it is better in every way, using the super key as main modifier, and having the alt and control extras

I dont miss touchid really

cant see the screen with polarized lense
