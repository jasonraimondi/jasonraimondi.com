Want to peek at that video file? No problem. Want to see what content is inside a text document. Quick Look has your back.

If you have never used a Mac, or are living in a box, macOS has an amazing feature that allows you to preview files without needing to open it. By just pressing `Space` or `Spacebar` on your Mac, you can preview the file in QuickLook.

You'll quickly realize that Quick Look does not support all file types. Like markdown, or 

```bash
brew cask install qlcolorcode qlstephen qlmarkdown quicklook-json qlimagesize webpquicklook suspicious-package quicklookase qlvideo
