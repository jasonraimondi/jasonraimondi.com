#### At Event Farm, we love throwing cool events with engaging, interactive technology.

At what was, in my opinion, one of the best events of our 2403 Main Street Office, we had a Art/Music show and decided to add a little even tech on top, and what came out of it was Flipp.

Meet Flipp:

Flipp was an interactive piece where guests of the event could enter their phone number to get access to a controller website on their mobile devices that would allow them to vote for different artworks hanging around the office, and when they voted, they would trigger a scene change on Phillips Hue lights, signaling a vote for the particular pieces.

Overall the exhibit was a huge hit, and we had a lot of fun making it.
