There are probably many lists out there like this, but this is my list.

## Fandango has some gross dark ux practices

* You cannot save a gift card you bought on it, you have to keep the physical gift card, and use it at the moment of checkout.
* You cannot scan or QR code the gift card, you have to enter the 27 digit (I didn't actually count) code manually.
* Credit cards can be saved... but not a gift card?
* No easy way to save tickets offline, must screenshot.
